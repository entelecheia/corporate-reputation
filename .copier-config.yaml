project_description: 'The reputation of a company and its CEO forms an intangible
    asset that significantly influences organizational success. With digital media
    becoming the central stage for public opinion formation, understanding and quantifying
    reputation has become more complex yet critically important. This study proposes
    an innovative approach to disentangle and measure the reputation of a company
    and its CEO using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) coupled with a signal
    model to trace the evolution of sentiment over time.


    The research first leverages ABSA, through a generative language modeling approach,
    to separately analyze sentiments associated with a company and its CEO. ABSA''s
    granular nature allows us to differentiate aspects associated with the CEO from
    those linked to the company, thereby creating distinct reputation metrics.


    Next, a signal model, built upon principles from the Stochastic Process Theory
    and probability density functions, is used to analyze sentiment evolution over
    time, providing insights into the dynamic nature of reputation. This model further
    quantifies the mutual information between the sentiment scores of the CEO and
    the company, assessing their interdependence and the influence they exert on each
    other.


    While recognizing the challenges associated with employing ABSA and the proposed
    signal model, this research highlights the potential of these tools to inform
    strategic decision-making. Whether it''s for companies striving to manage their
    reputation, investors evaluating corporate reputation, regulators ensuring compliance,
    or media organizations reporting on trends, the ability to separate and track
    the reputations of a company and its CEO could offer profound insights.


    The study, therefore, presents a new frontier in reputation analysis and management,
    enabling a granular, dynamic, and nuanced understanding of corporate and CEO reputations
    in the digital age.'
